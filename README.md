# Classification of Satellite Imagery with Deep Learning using Google Earth Engine (GEE-ANN)



Classification of Satellite Images Using Google Earth Engine JS API and TensorFlow
In this GitHub Repository You will find scripts for deep learning using ANN with Google Earth Engine and TensorFlow
First for Data Filtering and exporting We will use the GEE JS API. The data will be in the form on TensoFlow Records.
Second We will exports these TF record files for imagery and model training points to Google Cloud Bucket
**** Google Cloud Will Have Additional Costs Associated for Storage"**
There are two script files
File 1 contain GEE JS API (Javascript Code for Data Preparation and Exporting)
File 2 contain the Python File for the model


**Please Note :This model is an artificial neural network model. There are some more advanced models like convulutional NN models. **
